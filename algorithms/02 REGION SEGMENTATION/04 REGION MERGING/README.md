Region merging is a region-based image segmentation method. Instead of splitting the image until homogeneous regions are reached, in the region merging algorithm the homogeneous regions are constructed by merging voxels that have similar properties.

In the merging algorithm, the 3D image is traversed in a frames-rows-columns fashion. The algorithm starts by creating the first region which contains the first voxel of the image. Then, for each traversed voxel, merging with the neighboring regions is attempted. Merging is decided if the intensity of the current voxel is close to the mean intensity of the region under consideration. After the merging, the mean intensity of the region is updated. When merging criteria are satisfied by more than one regions, the region with the closest mean intensity is chosen. If no merging is possible with the neighboring regions, the algorithm tries to merge the voxel with non-neighboring regions. If merging is not possible, the algorithm creates a new region provided that the maximum allowed number of regions is not reached. The algorithm stops when all voxels have been visited.
